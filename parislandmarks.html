                <h3><i>Paris Monuments</i></h3>
                <p><strong>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed from 1887-89 as the centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution World's Fair. The design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of engineers Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853. The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world. The tower is about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Other Paris monuments include:Arc de Triomphe, Flamme de la Liberte, Colonne de Juillet, Luxor Obelisk, Monument aux Meres Frances Garden, Porte Saint-Martin, and Monuments de droite de la Homme.</strong></p>

                <h3><i>Paris Churches and Palaces</i></h3>
                <p><strong>Sacre-Coeur (Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris, commonly known as Sacre-Coeur Basilica) is a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Paris, France. A popular landmark, the basilica is located at the summit of the butte Montmartre, the highest point in the city. Sacre-Coeur is a double monument, political and cultural, both a national penance for the defeat of France in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War and the socialist Paris Commune of 1871, publicly dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It was consecrated after the end of World War I in 1919. Sacre-Coeur is asserted to be dedicated in honor of the 58,000 who lost their lives during the Franco Prussian war, which lasted from 1870 to 1871. Other Paris churches, chapels and cathedrals include: Notre-Dame de Paris, and Sainte-Chapelle. Palaces in Paris include: Grand Palais, Palais Royal, Petit Palais and Louvre Palace (at the Louvre).</strong></p>
