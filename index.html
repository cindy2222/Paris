<h2>MUST SEE-- Landmarks</h2>
<font size="6"> 
<p>Paris houses some of the most beautiful landmarks in the world. Up to date, the 
most popular landmark is the Eiffel tower. Many say that if you kiss the one you
love on top of the Eiffel tower, you will be together forever. The Louvre is also
a popular landmark that is said to house the Mona Lisa. Does this pyramid structure
look familiar? If it does you have probably seen it in movies such as Angels and 
Demons featuring Tom Hanks amongst others.When people think of Paris, people also
think of the Arc de Triomphe. It was erected as a tribute to remember those who fought 
during the Napoleonic wars and believe it or not, if you were to visit NYU in New York
you will see a similar structure on campus.  </font> </p>

<h2>Yum Yum-- Food!</h2>
<p>Besides the landmarks and the fashion, people come to Paris to experience authentic french 
cuisine. Some of the most popular are escargot, foie gras, beef bourguignon and bouillabaisse.
Among bakery style goods, baguettes with rocquefort cheese, fondue and macarons seem to be
the most enjoyable to tourists.</p>
